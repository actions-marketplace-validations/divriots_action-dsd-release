# DSD release action

This action releases a Design System from https://design-systems.dev

## Inputs

### api-token

**Required: yes**

This is the API token you can generate on https://design-systems.dev
We recommend you set it up as an action secret and use it as documented in the example section

### repo-token

**Required: if your repository is private**

This is the GitHub generated token for the action. It is automatically generated by GitHub, and can be
provided just by specifying **${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}**.
*http://design-systems.dev needs it in order to be able to clone your repository if it is private*

### component-id

**Required: yes**

This is the ID of the Design System you want to release. It can easily be extracted from the URL that you
are using when working on your Design System. For example, with https://design-systems.dev//edit/m7rLPfVrjtzOj7LGio3o/story-layout/src/index.tsx,
_m7rLPfVrjtzOj7LGio3o_ will be your ID.

### version

**Required: yes**

This is the version you want to release. You can provide the version you want, either
reading it from your package.json file or computing from tags - the choice is yours!

## Example usage

```

  api-token: ${{ secrets.DSD_API_TOKEN }}
  repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
